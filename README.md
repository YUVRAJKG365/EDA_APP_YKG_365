## 🤖 ML, NLP & AI Integrations

The app includes over **10 different ML algorithms**, suited for classification, regression, clustering, and forecasting:

### 🔬 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Gradient Boosting  
- Naive Bayes  
- Linear Regression  
- ARIMA / Seasonal Decomposition (Time Series)  
- Ensemble Voting Classifiers  
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE for visualization)  

### 📘 NLP Techniques

### 🤝 Gemini AI Integration
- 💬 **Gemini AI Assistant** acts as your smart EDA guide  
- Get auto-suggestions, interpretation of visualizations, column explanations, or even dataset summarization  
- Ask questions like:  
  > “What columns are correlated?”  
  > “Which feature affects prediction most?”  
  > “What does this visualization mean?”
